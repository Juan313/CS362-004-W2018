1. There is bug in the discardCard function inside dominion.c. I discovered this bug by examining the output from my unit test output in unittestresult.out file. It seems that when the trashFlag is set to 1, the current hand is not added to the played pile (trashed pile). When the trashFlag is set to 0, the current hand is not added to the discarded pile. It seems like the trashFlag is set in reverse. Another bug is that the card was never added to the discard pile regardless of how trashFlag is being set.


2. My unit test discovered another bug in the scoreFor function. The first bug is in the third for loop that count the score in the deck, the counter i is counted from 0 to the size of discarded pile instead of the size of the deck pile.  Another bug is that the score associated with garden card is calculated incorrectly. The function fullDeckCount calculate the number of a specific card that the player owns. However garden card gives you extra 1 point for every 10 cards that the player owns. Therefore fullDeckCount function is not the correct function to call. Also the way it calculates total number of cards will result in rounding error.

3. I also discovered a bug from my teammateâ€™s refactored smithy card effect function. I examined the unit test output result and realized that the hand count is always greater than expected hand count by 1 and the deck count is smaller than expected deck count by 1. I further examined his source code and realized that he introduced a bug in the for loop that draws three card as shown below. Since i is iterated from 0 to 3, it actually iterate 4 times, meaning the smithy function will draw 4 cards instead of 3. That explains why the hand count is always greater than expected hand count by 1.
